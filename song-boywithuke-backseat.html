    [Chorus]
    Dumbfounded, was your interest lost in translation?
    I can't find it, anywhere, no, I-I did I come off too strong?
    No cream inside my coffee cup
    I think she just wants to fuck, oh, okay

    [Verse]
    Had a little bit of what I want
    Had a little taste test looking for the one
    But I don't think Iâ€™m cut
    Catfish dinner for myself
    But I can't eat, I just wanna run
    So I decide to run right, looking directly into the sunlight
    Bleach my eyes and getting back in the church
    I can't right now, it's a fact right now, my bitch
    She a baddie, my daddy said I should have her-
    (She a baddie, my daddy said I should have her-)

    [Chorus]
    Dumbfounded, was your interest lost in translation?
    I can't find it, anywhere, no, I-I did I come off too strong?
    No cream inside my coffee cup
    I think she just wants to fuck, girl, okay

    [Interlude]
    (I think she just wants to fuck, so)

    [Bridge]
    Let's go in the backseat, we don't need a seatbelt
    I don't mind the mess but I'm stressing 'bout what she feels
    Looking at the moonlight, ooh, baby we could
    Kicking in the backseat, where I left my headphones
    Listen to my heartbeat, louder than a cellphone
    Teach me how to move, ooh, baby we could

    [Instrumental]
    (Let's go in my backseat, we don't need a seatbelt
    I don't mind the mess but I'm stressing 'bout what she feels
    Looking at the moonlight, ooh, baby we could
    Kicking in the backseat, where I left my headphones
    Listen to my heartbeat, louder than a cellphone
    Teach me how to move, ooh, baby we could)

    [Outro]
    Does it matter if it's real?
    If it's something I can't feel
    This imaginary love
    I met her in a dream so I'd rather stay asleep
    If it makes me happy
    This imaginary-
    (Love, love, love, love)
