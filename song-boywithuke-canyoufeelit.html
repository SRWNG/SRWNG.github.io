    [Intro]
    (Olé, olé, olé, olé, olé, olé)
    (Olé, olé, olé, olé, olé, olé)

    [Verse 1]
    Open blinds, but I can't find my way around
    I owe it to myself, I got a lot to figure out
    Got a knot in my belly, are you sure it's supposed to help me?
    It's been long enough to feel it, can you feel it?
    Aren't I supposed to feel it now?

    [Chorus]
    Tell me what you're thinking, I don't wanna have to shout
    Feel the heavy breathing on my chest and in my mouth
    Got two hands around my heart, I don't wanna see myself
    Burning bridges when I'm down (Hold up, watch my shit)

    [Verse 2]
    I'm falling, wondering how to spend my million hours
    Why you calling? Throwback to my bedroom with no colors
    My apartment, got no AC in my room
    Shoutout Verlaine and Rimbaud, you know what these (Haha) do
    Aren't I supposed to feel it now?

    [Chorus]
    Tell me what you're thinking, I don't wanna have to shout
    Feel the heavy breathing, on my chest and in my mouth
    Got two hands around my heart, I don't wanna see myself
    Burning bridges when I'm down (Hold up, watch my shit)
    I'm falling through the corridors, used to the broken flooring
    Sorry, I'm not sorry for what? I excused myself for pouring
    Lies out of my chest, my mess, hardly could even tell a story
    Lose me at my best, my next project might be the one that shoots me
    (Up, up, up, up)

    [Bridge]
    Then the stars in the sky light my bedroom
    Flashing words on the walls and my head too
    I'm alive, but I can't live without you
    Can't live without you
    And the thoughts in my head run in circles
    And the sheets on my bed turn to purple
    I'm alone, but I know that I won't do
    Nothing to hold you back
    Nothing to hold you back
    Nothing to hold you back

    [Spoken Interlude]
    And Berlin, it got so much better
    So from the bottom of my heart
    Thank you guys so much for giving me what I have today
    Seriously, big round of applause for yourselves

    [Outro]
    I just wanna go to sleep, but I don't know how to keep
    Separated from my thoughts, it's become a part of me
    If I'm alive at twenty-four, my life is a dichotomy
    I don't know what I wanna be, nobody better bother me
    I'm sleep-deprived and suicidal, thinking 'bout a lot of things
    I know it's in my mind, but sometimes it's just kinda hard to see
    Nobody really gives a fuck, it took a bit of time for me
    To realize I don't wanna be, I really didn't wanna be
    (Olé, olé, olé, olé, olé, olé)
    (I don't wanna be, wanna be)
    (Olé, olé, olé, olé)
    (I don't wanna be, wanna be)
