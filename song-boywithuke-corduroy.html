    [Verse 1]
    C
    Indifferent to the people I detest
             Am
    But, it harms me in a way that even I cannot detect
                Dm
    In my own flesh and blood

    (In my own flesh and blood)
                  G
    I think I've had enough
    
    (I think I've had enough, I've had enough)
        C
    I welcome death with open arms
                                  Am
    Like an old friend I haven't seen

    Since I was young, when young was old
                             Dm
    When Daddy did terrible things
                                                        G
    Maybe I'd feel better then, when I leave you like this

    (Don't let me leave, don't let me leave it all behind)
    C
    While some days are not that bad
                                 Am
    And even pleasant one might say

    I can't control the thoughts I have
                                 Dm
    I can't control the present wave of emotion
                            G
    Anxiously hoping for something or someone
    
    For anything at all

    [Pre-Chorus]
              C
    I can't imagine a life without familiarity
              Am
    I can't imagine what it's like to live
                                Dm
    With certainty, I like to rewatch movies

    So I know the end of every scene
                G
    I know the end of everything

    I do, because I won't ever leave my room
           C
    It's safer here, safety's all I want and all I need
                Am
    Buried my issues here, deep within the

    Walls and in my dreams
                Dm
    In my own atmosphere is where I'll die

    So, let me die in peace
                G
    I'm on my final breath, my final steps

    I've never felt so free

    [Chorus]
             C
    But my head's spinning
                                        Am
    I can't help but think of who I'm abandoning
                                    Dm
    Suddenly my chest cries out in pure panic
    
    It cannot end like this
                  G
    I say with strength I haven't felt before

    And that's when it finally hits
              C
    With my hands sweating

    Climb down from the ledge of
                    Am
    What's all so threatening

    But it don't cause me fear no more
        Dm
    My fingers touch the fabric of my

    Jacket made of corduroy
        G
    Reminding me of Brentwood and the
                                    C
    Things that I would die to see again

    [Instrumental Breakdown]
                Am
    Die to see again (g-g-gain)
                Dm
    Die to see again (g-g-gain)
                G
    Die to see again (g-g-gain)

    [Verse 2]

    Woah, oh
         C
    My jacket made of corduroy
                                    Am
    Oh I stand to lose my life, my soul

    My time my home, my thoughts

    My sweet and sour youth
                Dm
    I can't let go of who I was but I

    Can cut myself in two
                G
    And I can pick up all the pieces

    And let everybody choose

    [Bridge]
                                 C                           Am
    Yeah, yeah it's all in your mind, boy, it's all in your head
                    Dm                              G
    Leave it all behind you can finish when you're dead
                             C
    I'll be waiting for you here
                                Am
    When this madness finally ends 
                      Dm                G
    Remember who you are, don't forget her

    [Chorus]
                C
    When your head's spinning
                                Am
    Stuck in a room with the television on

    While you're tripping on shrooms
                  Dm
    You got your thoughts spilling
                                    G
    But none of it's true, it's a facade

    Your heart can tear apart the parts

    That make it you

    [Instrumental]

    [Outro]
      C
    Hello again, it's nice to see you're back
             Am
    Did you like the things you saw
                                            Dm
    Do you finally understand why I wear corduroy?
                     G
    I really like corduroy
    C
    Hello my friend, anything you'd like to ask
            Am
    Any unresolved illusions in your head that make you gag?
                  Dm
    I'm just one call away
                    G                        C
    So please don't be afraid to call me back
