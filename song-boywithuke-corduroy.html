    [Verse 1]
    Indifferent to the people I detest
    But, it harms me in a way that even I cannot detect
    In my own flesh and blood
    (In my own flesh and blood)
    I think I've had enough
    (I think I've had enough, I've had enough)
    I welcome death with open arms
    Like an old friend I haven't seen
    Since I was young, when young was old
    When Daddy did terrible things
    Maybe I'd feel better then, when I leave you like this
    (Don't let me leave, don't let me leave it all behind)
    While some days are not that bad
    And even pleasant one might say
    I can't control the thoughts I have
    I can't control the present wave of emotion
    Anxiously hoping for something or someone
    For anything at all

    [Pre-Chorus]
    I can't imagine a life without familiarity
    I can't imagine what it's like to live
    With certainty, I like to rewatch movies
    So I know the end of every scene
    I know the end of everything
    I do, because I won't ever leave my room
    It's safer here, safety's all I want and all I need
    Buried my issues here, deep within the
    Walls and in my dreams
    In my own atmosphere is where I'll die
    So, let me die in peace
    I'm on my final breath, my final steps
    I've never felt so free

    [Chorus]
    But my head's spinning
    I can't help but think of who I'm abandoning
    Suddenly my chest cries out in pure panic
    It cannot end like this
    I say with strength I haven't felt before
    And that's when it finally hits
    With my hands sweating
    Climb down from the ledge of
    What's all so threatening
    But it don't cause me fear no more
    My fingers touch the fabric of my
    Jacket made of corduroy
    Reminding me of Brentwood and the
    Things that I would die to see again

    [Instrumental Breakdown]
    Die to see again (g-g-gain)
    Die to see again (g-g-gain)
    Die to see again (g-g-gain)

    [Verse 2]
    Woah, oh
    My jacket made of corduroy
    Oh I stand to lose my life, my soul
    My time my home, my thoughts
    My sweet and sour youth
    I can't let go of who I was but I
    Can cut myself in two
    And I can pick up all the pieces
    And let everybody choose

    [Bridge]
    Yeah, yeah it's all in your mind, boy, it's all in your head
    Leave it all behind you can finish when you're dead
    I'll be waiting for you here
    When this madness finally ends
    Remember who you are, don't forget her

    [Chorus]
    When your head's spinning
    Stuck in a room with the television on
    While you're tripping on shrooms
    You got your thoughts spilling
    But none of it's true, it's a facade
    Your heart can tear apart the parts
    That make it you

    [Instrumental]

    [Outro]
    Hello again, it's nice to see you're back
    Did you like the things you saw
    Do you finally understand why I wear corduroy?
    I really like corduroy
    Hello my friend, anything you'd like to ask
    Any unresolved illusions in your head that make you gag?
    I'm just one call away
    So please don't be afraid to call me back
