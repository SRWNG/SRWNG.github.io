    [Instrumental]

    [Verse 1]
    I know it's been a minute since we last spoke
    Been every type of bitter this year
    There's something sentimental 'bout the thought of it all
    But your tears are all I hear
    I should've loved you better
    I wish I could have been there
    I wish we never met so maybe then I wouldn't see you everywhere
    But you're so independent; need no one but yourself
    I don't know how you do it inhibition for my guilt too 'course
    I made a mistake
    Pushed you away, so I grieved your loss
    Killed every single memory, killed every thought, killed everything

    [Chorus]
    'Cause it might be easier that way
    If I never had to see your face
    If I could pretend we never met
    Maybe then I'd feel okay
    But how can I act like you're a stranger?
    If you were the only one who knew me
    I live in a city full of people, but I am alone

    [Bridge]
    The comfort of your arms was the only thing I knew
    Getting out of bed, is so easy without you
    Silence in my car, helps me focus when I drive
    Used to be so hard when I had you by my side

    [Instrumental]

    [Verse 2]
    Waking up at night, ripping out my hair
    I'm used to having fights, used to hurting everybody that I care for
    It's unfair, everybody lives their own life
    That I'm never there for, and I lie and I steal time from everyone who ever cried, when I cry, lights on
    You can put it on my grave when I die
    At the top of the plaque, "Here lies in his tomb a fucking waste of a man"
    I got to learn to let go, I got to learn to move on
    Got a lot I don't know, I have to learn to let go
    If I don't change who I am Ima die before I'm old
    But I can't help but hide myself behind my world of lies
    I made to cope with who I lost I killed you here

    [Chorus]
    'Cause it might be easier that way
    If I never had to see your face
    If I could pretend we never met
    Maybe then I'd feel okay
    But how can I act like you're a stranger?
    If you were the only one who knew me
    I live in a city full of people, but I am alone

    [Instrumental]
    (Alone)
    (Ahh, ahh, ahh)
    (Ahh, ahh, ahh)
    (Ahh, ahh, ahh)
