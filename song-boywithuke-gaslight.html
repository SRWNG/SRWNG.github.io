    [Verse 1]
    You hold me like flowers to your chest
    Suffocate, yet still, I rest
    You hurt me with malice again
    Must have learned that trait from one of your friends

    [Bridge]
    It's like you're bad for me
    And I might just be the same
    I don't know another way, so I let you

    [Verse 2]
    I'd give you the reins (Oh-oh-oh)
    It's so easy with a pretty face (Oh-oh-oh)
    But I know in my heart what you are is a monster (Oh-ah-oh)
    And we can't be together, a shame (Oh-oh-oh)

    [Chorus]
    So what you gonna do?
    You can cut me with your words, you can keep my thrifted shirt
    You can keep all of our friends since at least I know my worth
    Even if you were my world, I'll just numb myself with work
    And if this is all I have, then I know I'll be okay
    Rather die and be alone than to love and be in pain

    [Post-Chorus]
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Rather die and be alone than to love and be in pain)
    Oh-ah-oh, oh-oh-oh
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Rather die and be alone than to love and be in pain)
    Oh-ah-oh, oh-oh-oh

    [Outro]
    One day, I'll look down, and I'll dance on top your grave one last time
    And I'll whisper, that I slept with your sister
    (Hahaha)
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
    Oh-ah-oh, oh-oh-oh
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
    Oh-ah-oh, oh-oh-oh
