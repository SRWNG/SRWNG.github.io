    [Intro]
    I should've told you
    When I had the chance
    (ecnahc eht dah I nehw uoy dlot ev'dluohs I)

    [Chorus]
                Dm                       G
    I should've told you when I had the chance
                 Em                F
    Lost in the memories we don't have
                 Dm                     G
    I wanted to hold you in hopeless romance
     Em                    F
    Mmm, you fade like a ghost

    [Verse 1]
                    Dm
    I've been from London to Aberdeen (Wow)
     G                          Em                  F
    Inside a coupe and from inside a private limousine (Cool?)
                            Dm                  G
    Do you think it really matters if I wear designer? (No)
                                     Em                             F
    'Cause I don't, if I don't have her, what's the point of finer things? (Things, things, things)
            Dm                   G
    I'm ex-nihilo, like Augustine (Amen)
                             Em                     F
    But I confess I haven't been the best internally (Why not?)
                    Dm              G
    I keep seeing two moons in my dreams (Again?)
                                Em              F
    Can you tell me what they really mean?

    [Chorus]
                Dm                       G
    I should've told you when I had the chance
                 Em                F
    Lost in the memories we don't have
                 Dm                     G
    I wanted to hold you in hopeless romance
     Em                    F
    Mmm, you fade like a ghost

    [Bridge]
             Dm
    Can you catch me when I fall? (Fall)
            G
    I'm in love with the idea (Idea)
        Em                  F
    Of who you are (I'm in love with a lie)
                Dm
    I tried to look the other way
              G
    But I'm lying to myself
             Em            F
    I never wanted it to end

    [Verse 2]
                    Dm
    I had no other option
                                              G
    I had to find a way to leave before you walked in
                                            Em
    At the end the chase was all I really wanted
                   
    But it's too late for that
                F
    You give heart attacks
                            Dm
    And I find it hard to sleep (It's hard to sleep, it's hard to sleep)
                                                        G
    'Cause I'm afraid of ghosts, and I can hear you talking (Blah, blah, blah, blah)
                                        Em
    So perpetual, you show no sign of stopping (Stop)
                                                F
    It's too late for that (Fuck), can't you understand? (Ah)

    [Chorus]
                Dm                       
    I should've told you (Told you, told you)
                    G
    When I had the chance (I had the chance, I had the chance)
                 Em                F
    Lost in the memories we don't have (Never had it, never have)
                 Dm
    I wanted to hold you (I wanted holding onto hope)
                     G
    In hopeless romance (Hopeless romance)
     Em                     F
    Mmm, you fade like a ghost (Like a ghost, like a ghost)

    [Post-Chorus]
    (Ahh, you fade like a ghost)
    (Ahh, you fade like a ghost)

    [Instrumental Break]
    (I should've told you)
    (When I had the chance)
    (Lost in the memories we don't haâ€”)

    [Outro]
    Dm
    You could at least just make it easy (Easy)
    G
    You know I hate bein' so needy (Needy)
    Em
    Got my attention on a leash and I don't want it back
    F
    Unintentionally acting creepy (Creepy)
    Dm
    In front of her, but she can't see me (Can't see)
    G
    I think she thinks I'm on the spectrum (I was the ghost)
    Em
    I'm pretty sure she wants to leave (Want's to leave)
    F
    And I don't blame her
