                        Dm
            I should've told you
                            G
            When I had the chance
            Em
            I should've told you when I had the chance
            F
            Lost in the memories we don't have
            C                       E7
            I wanted to hold you in hopeless romance
            Am          Am
            Mm, you fade like a ghost
            I've been from London to Aberdeen (wow)
            Inside a coupe and from inside a private limousine (cool)
            Do you think it really matters if I wear designer? (No)
            'Cause I don't, if I don't have her, what's the point of finer things?
            I'm ex nihilo, like Augustine (amen)
            But I confess I haven't been the best internally (why not?)
            I keep seeing two moons in my dreams (again?)
            Can you tell me what they really mean?
            I should've told you when I had the chance
            Lost in the memories we don't have
            I wanted to hold you in hopeless romance
            Mm, you fade like a ghost
            Can you catch me when I fall? (Fall)
            I'm in love with the idea (idea)
            Of who you are (I'm in love with a lie)
            I tried to look the other way
            But I'm lying to myself
            I never wanted it to end
            I had no other option
            I had to find a way to leave before you walked in
            At the end, the chase was all I really wanted
            But it's too late for that, you give heart attacks
            And I find it hard to sleep (it's hard to sleep)
            'Cause I'm afraid of ghosts, and I can hear you talking
            So perpetual, you show no sign of stopping (stop)
            It's too late for that, can't you understand? (Ah)
            I should've told you (told you, told you)
            When I had the chance (I had the chance, I had the chance)
            Lost in the memories we don't have (never had it, never have)
            I wanted to hold you (holding onto hope)
            In hopeless romance (hopeless romance)
            Mm, you fade like a ghost (like a ghost, like a ghost)
            You fade like a ghost
            You fade like a ghost
            I should've told you
            When I had the chance
            You could at least just make it easy (easy)
            You know I hate being so needy (needy)
            Got my attention on a leash and I don't want it back
            Unintentionally acting creepy (creepy)
            In front of her, but she can't see me (can't see)
            I think she thinks I'm on the spectrum, oh (oh)
            I'm pretty sure she wants to leave (wants to leave)
            And I don't blame her
