    [Intro]
    Ooh, ooh
    Ooh, ooh

    [Verse 1]
    We walked through the door of our new apartment
    We're laughing the whole time
    I hold your hands in mine, we share a smile
    A box in hand and you in the other
    You smell like lavander, like my mother
    And then, the lights turn green

    [Chorus]
    What have I done?
    Have I made a mistake?
    Cause I can't remember why I feel this way
    My life flashes by, as I drive away
    My home is not my home no more
    My home is now my grave

    [Post-Chorus]
    Ooh, ooh
    Ooh, ooh

    [Verse 2]
    The gifts you gave me, I'll keep them safe
    Though bittersweet in their aftertaste
    So many songs that'll never sound the same
    Stuffed animals that used to light up the room
    Felt like how I fell out of love with you
    Out of sight, but I see you everyday
    Oh, why the hell do I keep recalling
    The good, the great, I had all I wanted
    How on earth did I lose it in a day?
    I left my sweatshirt at her place
    I'm turning back to my old ways
    Can't keep commitments
    I'm the same as what I hated
    Ain't it funny how we change?

    [Chorus]
    What have I done?
    Have I made a mistake?
    Cause I can't remember why I feel this way
    My life flashes by, as I drive away
    My home is not my home no more
    My home is now my grave

    [Post-Chorus]
    Ooh, ooh
    I never knew
    All this love was new to me
    Ooh, ooh
    I never knew, oh
    What it would do to me
    Ooh
    I never knew
    All this love was new to me
    Ooh, ooh
    I never knew, oh-

    [Chorus]
    What have I done?
    I've made a mistake
    'Cause I can't remember, no I can't remember
    Why I feel this way, life flashes by
    As I drive away
    My home is not my home no more
    My home is now my-

    [Bridge]
    I miss your laugh, I miss your face
    I took your half, and threw it all away
    I hate myself, I hate this pain
    I hate that I lost everything

    [Outro]
    It's cold outside, this time of year
    But its colder now, that you're not here
    I've lost my rock, and I've lost my friend
    I never want to see a goldfish again
