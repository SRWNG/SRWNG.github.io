    [Verse 1]
    Flowing, river made of rain
    Winding down the mountain of everything I hate
    Photos, I took from better days
    Nice to know their color never seems to fade

    [Chorus]
    If only I were smart enough to know what's good for me
    If I didn't feel so confident would I be so naive?
    If I could turn back time and try again then
    Maybe we could've been something more

    [Verse 2]
    Perfect glitter on your face
    Light behind your eyes flicker like a flame
    Burning, but comfort from your gaze
    All I feel is hurt, but I can't look away

    [Chorus]
    If only I were smart enough to know what's good for me
    If I didn't feel so confident would I be so naive?
    If I could turn back time and try again then
    Maybe we could've been something more
