    [Verse 1]
    She was a stranger, a mysterious soul
    I couldn't read her
    She got the eyes of a ghost
    Too far to walk back to my hotel down in Brooklyn
    Hoping that nobody's looking for me
    She says she got a boyfriend, but she wants to get a drink
    It's not the weekend and she got a class for Ivy League
    She's just a stranger, but it seems as if she doesn't want to be

    [Chorus]
    Ooh, tell me what you want
    The barista has no patience
    And my parka's in the car
    Ooh, tell me what you're on
    I can tell you're somewhere else
    You're slipping in and out of
    In and out of thought

    [Post-Chorus]
    Thought, thought, thought, thought
    Thought, thought, ta, da-da-da-da
    You're slipping in and out of, in and out of thought
    Thought, thought, thought, thought
    Thought, thought, ta, da-da-da-da
    You're slipping in and out of, in and out of thought

    [Verse 2]
    She says she hopes I'm doing well
    That I'm incredible to see, can't lie
    My heart skipped a beat
    When I saw her through a shrouded veil
    But she like a wolf in sheep's wool she tryna play it cool
    As if we go way back as friends, she tryna make some sort of sense
    What the hell? We in this parking lot
    Talking 'bout things we never did
    Throwback to my busboy days
    Back when I had a 40 hour week, and a shitshow pay
    Laid back on the weekends
    Swam so far but everybody tweaking
    I just wanna sleep all day

    [Chorus]
    Ooh, tell me what you want
    The barista has no patience
    And my parka's in the car
    Ooh, tell me what you're on
    I can tell you're somewhere else
    You're slipping in and out of
    In and out of thought

    [Post-Chorus]
    Thought, thought, thought, thought
    Thought, thought, ta, da-da-da-da
    You're slipping in and out of, in and out of thought
    Thought, thought, thought, thought
    Thought, thought, ta, da-da-da-da
    You're slipping in and out of, in and out of thought

    [Verse 3]
    *Lyrics from a tiktok live performance, these lyrics aren’t confirmed
    …
    Eyes glued to me body
    Says she’s sorry for the fall off
    I’ve been on xans and testing mali’
    … fate
    Falling back to former ways
    Sorry i’m not sorry i’m not capable of change.
    Fucking this bitch, I met on the internet
    She sucking my d--k like no one I ever met
    My money big, my attitude feminine
    Call me a bitch 'cause I smell like cinnamon
    But I've been working harder in silence
    Half of these people never seen violence
    Half of the shit that I say is timeless, so rhymeless
    … fuck

    [Chorus]
    Ooh, tell me what you want
    The barista has no patience
    And my parka's in the car
    Ooh, tell me what you’re on
    I can tell you're somewhere else
    You're slipping in and out of
    In and out of thought

    [Post-Chorus]
    Thought, thought, thought, thought
    Thought, thought, ta, da-da-da-da
    You’re slipping in and out of, in and out of thought
    Thought, thought, thought, thought
    Thought, thought, ta, da-da-da-da
    You're slipping in and out of, in and out of thought
